<h1>Business Objects (Technology Preview)</h1>
<p>Stardust provides support for a
business object-centric view on Process Data.</p>

<!--  It represents business entities such as an invoice, a transaction or a person -->
<h2 id="mot">Common Use Cases</h2>
<p>In many cases you might intend to access process information via the business objects 
the processes are working on, for example:</p>
<ul>
   <li>List all processes on an insured person during document indexing</li>
   <li>List the status of the daily processing on a fund</li>
</ul>
<p>In Stardust these objects are mostly Process Data 
(e.g. named <strong>Claim, Order, Trade, Fund</strong>) of a specific structured data type
(e.g. <strong>Claim, Order, Trade, Fund</strong>) whose values or instances are stored in 
the <a href="../handbooks/operation/audit-trail/ag-appendix-audittrail-1.htm#struct_data_val">structured_data_value</a>
table of the audit trail.</p>
<p>As different processes store (independent) process data, referring to the same business object 
via a Primary Key (e.g. <strong>Member Id, Fund Name</strong>) an implicit version history 
of the Business Object is created. The latest version could be considered the "current state 
of a Business Object as known to Stardust".</p>
<p>Stardust Business Objects Management allows you to search for Business Objects, 
find corresponding Process Instances and even update and/or create Business Objects 
independently of Processes creating Process Data.</p>
<h2 id="portal">Using Business Objects in the Stardust Portal</h2>
<h3 id="mark">Marking Process Data as Business Objects</h3>
<p>You can mark process data of structured type as Business Objects.
A primary key out of the (top-level) data of the structured data type can be defined, which 
allows to identify the Business Object in the Browser Modeler.</p>
<p>Relationships to other Business Objects can be created by specifying fields
with single or multiple cardinality to serve as foreign keys to other Business Objects.</p>

<p>For details on marking process data as Business Object, please refer to chapter

<h3 id="mngmt">Managing Business Objects in the Stardust Portal</h3>
<p>The Stardust Portal provides a view in the Business Control Center 
perspective to manage Business Objects. It allows to:</p>
<ul>
   <li>search for Business Object Instances</li>
   <li>find corresponding Process Instances</li>
   <li>update Business Object Instances</li>
   <li>add Business Object Instances independently of Processes</li>
</ul>
<p>For details on this view, please refer to chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/businessObjectManagement.html">
Managing Business Objects</a> in the
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/carnot-clients.html">
Stardust Portal</a> documentation.</p>
