      <li>Key combinations that are used as shortcuts in SWT applications. <li>Click counts on trees. The select actions are correctly recorded, but the click count is set to 0 and must be manually adjusted. <li>Components that contain texts that are too long (more than 3999 characters). <li>Actions on native dialogs e.g. file choosers. <li>Actions in the figure canvas for GEF components. </ul>
