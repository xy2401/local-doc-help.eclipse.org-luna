    <p> Tests are automated completely from the user perspective and require no programming effort. <br />
    <p> This means that those who understand the user perspective best are able to fully automate tests. There is no need to wait for input (e.g. programmatic creation of test modules) from other team members to automate a test. If developers are writing tests, the black box perspective encourages them to think like a user would when faced with the software. Code-free tests also have the advantage that they are readable by the whole team and also by users or customers. <p>
