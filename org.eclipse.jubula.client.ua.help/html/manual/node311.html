    <p> You can open the label decoration preferences by selecting <i>General - Appearance - Label Decorations</i> from the preference dialog. <p> From this preference page, you can alter your preferences for: <dl>
        <dt><strong>Completeness Check Decorator:</strong><dd> We recommend leaving this decorator active, as it shows you red crosses and tooltips in the Test Suite Browser when Test Suites and Test Jobs are incomplete. <dt><strong>Test Result Duration Decorator:</strong><dd>Deactivate this option to not see the execution time required for each node in the Test Result View . The times shown are for the execution of each node, including its children. You can use this information to see whether specific Test Cases are taking longer than you expect them to. <dt><strong>Test Result Parameter Decorator:</strong><dd>Deactivate this option to not see the parameter values used at this node (i.e. either entered at this level, or actually used at this place) in the Test Result View . You can use this information to easily see which data were used for your Test Cases , without having to click through each individual node in the Test Result View . This can be especially useful if you have one Test Case that runs multiple times with different datasets. </dl>
