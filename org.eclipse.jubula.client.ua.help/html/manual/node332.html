    <p><a name="6434"></a><p> We have designed the observation mode to help you get started with your tests and to help you understand what sort of user actions correspond to actions in the library. <p> The ITE is first and foremost a keyword-driven tool, and the library of Test Cases installed means that you have various benefits over simple recording: <p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can create tests without needing the AUT - you don&#39;t have to wait for each version of the AUT to begin test specification. <li>Your tests aren&#39;t so dependent on the actual implementation of the AUT , so they can be a lot more general in terms of data, component implementations etc. and therefore a lot more robust and maintainable. <li>Using keywords encourages you to think about your test structure a lot more, which also helps maintenance later. <p>
      </ul>
    <p> Nevertheless, we understand that you may want to observe some Test Cases . Here are some tips that might help you: <ul>
        <li>Think about your test structure at the beginning: what modules will you want to reuse? Start by observing small Test Cases , e.g. a Test Case to login, a Test Case to open a dialog etc. <li>Check while you are observing that the actions you carry out are observed in the way you meant. <li>Supplement your observed Test Cases with other Test Cases from the library of Test Cases installed. <li>Refactor as you go! If you have recorded a Test Case with specific data, but you will want to use it for any type of data, then add a reference for the data. </ul>
