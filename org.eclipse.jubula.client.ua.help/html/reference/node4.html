      <ul>
        <li>Using regular expressions lets you verify or select text even if you do not know exactly what the text is. <li>Using a system of placeholders for characters and some function symbols, you can enter a regular expression to find or check a text. <li>Actions which support regular expressions have an additional parameter, &quot;<i>Operator</i>&quot;. From this combo box, you can choose &quot;<i>matches</i>&quot; to indicate that you want to use regular expressions. </ul>
    <p><span class="textbf">Simple matching</span><ul>
        <li><tt>&quot;abc&quot;</tt> matches &quot;<i>abc</i>&quot; and nothing else. </ul>
    <p><span class="textbf">Wildcards</span><ul>
        <li><tt>&quot;.&quot;</tt> represents one instance of any character. <li><tt>&quot;..&quot;</tt> represents two characters. </ul>
    <p><span class="textbf">Repetition</span><ul>
        <li>Instead of using <tt>&quot;.&quot;</tt> for each character, you can use symbols to indicate how many characters you are replacing with wildcards. <li><tt>&quot;?&quot;</tt> matches the previous character or group 0 or 1 time(s). E.g. <tt>&quot;a?&quot;</tt> represents &#39;&#39;none or one <tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt>&#39;&#39;. <li><tt>&quot;*&quot;</tt> matches the previous character or group 0 or more time(s). E.g. <tt>&quot;a*&quot;</tt> represents &#39;&#39;none or more <tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt>&#39;&#39;. <li><tt>&quot;+&quot;</tt> matches the previous character or group 1 or more time(s). E.g. <tt>&quot;a+&quot;</tt> represents &#39;&#39;one or more <tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt>&#39;&#39;. <li>You can also use curly brackets <tt>&quot;{}&quot;</tt> to specify the minimum and maximum number of repetitions, e.g. <tt>&quot;{4,7}&quot;</tt> looks for a minimum of four and a maximum of seven repetitions of the previous character. <li>To specify that a character must be repeated a minimum of four times, use: <tt>&quot;{4,}&quot;</tt></ul>
    <p><span class="textbf">Combining wildcards with repetition</span><ul>
        <li>You can specify a whole area of unknown text using <tt>&quot;.&quot;</tt> and one of the repetition methods. <li><tt>&quot;.*&quot;</tt> is an unlimited amount of any character, or none at all. <li><tt>&quot;.?&quot;</tt> is 0 or one of any character. <li><tt>&quot;.+&quot;</tt> is an unlimited amount of any character, but the character must appear at least once. </ul>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><img align="BOTTOM" alt="\includegraphics[height=2cm]{lightbulb}" border="0" height="91" src="img1.jpg" width="101" /></td>
          <td><b>The regular expression is applied to your entire string. To search for a match within a string, wildcards need to be placed on either side. See the examples below for more information.</b></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    <p><span class="textbf">Ranges</span><ul>
        <li>For each individual character, you can specify a range of things it is allowed to be. <li>A range is specified using square brackets (<tt>&quot;[]&quot;</tt>) and a dash <tt>&quot;-&quot;</tt>. <li>For example, you can specify that a particular character can be any capital letter: <tt>&quot;[A-Z]&quot;</tt>. </ul>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><img align="BOTTOM" alt="\includegraphics[height=2cm]{lightbulb}" border="0" height="91" src="img1.jpg" width="101" /></td>
          <td><b>Note that there are no spaces between the ranges. </b></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    <p><span class="textbf">Alternatives</span><ul>
        <li>Use a pipe (&#39;<tt>|</tt>&#39;) to specify alternatives. <li>For example, <tt>&quot;[a|b].*&quot;</tt> will match a string that begins with <tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;b&quot;</tt>. </ul>
    <p><span class="textbf">Escape character</span><ul>
        <li>Backslash <tt>&quot;<span class="MATH"><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$\backslash$" border="0" height="38" src="img2.gif" width="15" /></span>&quot;</tt> is used to negate the effect of the character following the backslash. <li>The characters that are used to construct a regular expression need to be escaped if they are to be matched within a string. <li>The characters are: <br /><code> [ ] \ . | ? * + ( ) { } ^ $ </code><br />
        <li>Because backslash is already used as an escape symbol, you will need to use two backslashes to escape regular expression characters. <li>For example, to check for a tree node: <br /><tt>&quot;x/y/z/***&quot;</tt><br /> where the slashes are a part of the node, your regular expression in the ITE would look like this: <code> x\/y\/z\/\\*\\*\\* </code><br /> The backslashes before the ordinary slashes are an escape symbol to specify that the following sign is not a path separator. The extra backslash before the stars means that the second backslash is to be interpreted as a backslash in the regular expression, i.e. as an escape symbol. <li>E.g. If you want to check for a star (<tt>&quot;*&quot;</tt>), then you have to enter <tt>&quot;<span class="MATH"><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$\backslash$" border="0" height="38" src="img2.gif" width="15" /></span><span class="MATH"><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$\backslash$" border="0" height="38" src="img2.gif" width="15" /></span>*&quot;</tt>. </ul>
    <p><span class="textbf">Verbatim</span><ul>
        <li>You can avoid having to use multiple backslashes by putting the whole regular expression in single quotes: <li>The example above for a tree node could be entered thus: <br /><tt>&quot;&#39;x/y/z/***&#39;&quot;</tt></ul>
    <p><span class="textbf">Useful examples</span><ul>
        <li>An empty field is represented by: <code>^$</code><li>A string that starts with <tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt> is represented by: <tt>&quot;a.*&quot;</tt><li>A string that ends in <tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt> is represented by: <tt>&quot;.*a&quot;</tt><li>A string that starts with <tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt>, ends in <tt>&quot;b&quot;</tt> and has unknown values (0 or more) in the middle is represented by: <tt>&quot;a.*b&quot;</tt><li>A string which contains <tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt> somewhere between other unknown characters (0 or more) is represented by: <tt>&quot;.*a.*&quot;</tt><li>A password which can only contain capital letters and which must be between six and eight letters is represented by: <tt>&quot;[A-Z]{6,8}&quot;</tt>. <li>A password which can contain any alphanumerical values and which must be at least six characters is represented by: <tt>&quot;[A-Za-z0-9]{6,}&quot;</tt>. <li>You can check that a string corresponds to a minimum and maximum length using: <br /><code>&#39;^.{&#39;={MIN_COUNT}&#39;,&#39;={MAX_COUNT}&#39;}$&#39;</code><li>To check for a text which begins with a <tt>&quot;*&quot;</tt>, you must use the escape character: <code>\\*.*</code><li>To check that a specific string is <span class="textit">not</span> in a text, use: <br /><code>^((?!STRING)[\s\S])*$</code></ul>
