    <p> You can add a task ID to Test Cases and Test Suites in your Project . <p> The task ID should be a valid ID in the repository that you have specified as the repository for this Project <a href="node259.html#TasksALMConfigureProject">3.22.4.1</a>. Adding the task ID to an item in your Project means that this item is the relevant test for that task in your repository. You will be able to report test results for this item as a comment to the task in the repository. The comment will include a link to the dashboard, in which the test result report can be viewed. <p> To add a task ID to a Test Case or Test Suite : <ol>
        <li>Open the item in the editor by double-clicking it. <li>In the Properties View , in the cell for <i>Task ID</i>, enter the task ID from the external repository. You can only enter task IDs at the place of specification - you cannot overwrite them when you reuse the item. <li>Save the editor. <li>When you have added a task ID to a node, you can open the task for this node from the browser by selecting: <br />
