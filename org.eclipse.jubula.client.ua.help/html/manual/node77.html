You can optionally enter a property which should be displayed alongside the change type to track e.g. the user that made the change. The changes that lead to change information being shown are: <ul>
        <li>The creation of a node. <li>Any time an editor is saved (renaming within an editor, adding Test Cases to an editor, removing Test Cases from an editor, adding data or component names, using the refactor actions from within an editor. </ul> Project -wide refactor actions, such as those started from the search result view, and any renaming in browsers, are not shown in the change information. <p>
