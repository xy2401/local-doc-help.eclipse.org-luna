    <h2><a name="SECTION00565000000000000000"> <span class="arabic">4</span>.<span class="arabic">6</span>.<span class="arabic">5</span> Operating system language, component recognition and extensibility</a></h2> The UI automation framework does not provide language-independent component types for component recognition. As this would have otherwise lead to language-dependent mapping, we have implemented an internal map from the component type ID to our own designation of the component type. This makes object mapping language-independent, but means that the Windows toolkit cannot currently be extended to add support for new components. <p>
