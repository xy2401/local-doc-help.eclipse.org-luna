We recommend reading the information on addressing the correct component in your iOS tests in the section on Toolkits <a href="node444.html#ToolkitiOSCorrectComponent">4.7.4</a>. <dl>
        <dt><strong>Single tap:</strong><dd>This collects the component directly underneath your finger or the mouse cursor. <dt><strong>Double tap:</strong><dd>This collects the component directly underneath your finger or the mouse cursor, plus its direct parent. For example, if you want to collect a OK button, but you click on the &#39;&#39;OK&#39;&#39; label, then a double tap will collect both the label and the button. Double taps are recommended for collecting any components that have text on them - a single tap may only collect the label, whereas a double-tap will collect the label and the component it is in. <dt><strong>Long tap:</strong><dd>This collects the component directly underneath your finger or the mouse cursor, plus all of its parents. This is useful if you want to collect disabled components (which cannot be collected with a single tap), or if you want to address components that are &#39;&#39;hard to reach&#39;&#39; with a single or double tap. </dl>
