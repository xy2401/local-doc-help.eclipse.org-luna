    <p><a name="8543"></a> <a name="8544"></a><p> When using a multi-user database, multiple testers can work on a single Project concurrently. <p> Within such a scenario, all testers currently working on a Project may view and execute all parts of it. As soon as one tester alters a part of the Project , a lock is placed on that unit to disallow other users from making changes of their own. They are, however, still able to view and execute a locked test unit. Once the user with the lock has saved all changes, the lock is removed, and the test unit is once again available for editing. <p> This database scenario is well-suited for larger testing operations, allowing for tight collaboration among testers and reducing the overall time needed to specify complex testing projects. <p>
