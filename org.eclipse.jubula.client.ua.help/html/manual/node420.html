    <p> The following AUT&#39;s written with the .NET framework are supported: <p>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be using Windows XP or higher. <li>We have performed our WinForms and WPF tests with an AUT in .NET version 4.0. Although tests may be also be executable with .NET 3.5 (or even lower), the minimum supported version is .NET 4.0. <table>

              <td><img align="BOTTOM" alt="\includegraphics[height=2cm]{danger}" border="0" height="89" src="img1.jpg" width="102" /></td>
              <td><b>The support for WPF AUT&#39;s is currently experimental. We encourage you to test the support with your own AUT&#39;s and welcome feedback about the current support.</b></td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        <li>AUT&#39;s that are not written with WinForms or WPF (e.g. Win32, etc.) are not supported in the current version. </ul>
