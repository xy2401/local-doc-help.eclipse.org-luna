If a property is not accessible, you will see a notice informing you of this. <p> You can use this information to help you write tests that use the actions <i>check property</i> and <i>store property</i>. <p> The property information is not saved when the Object Mapping Editor is saved: to view property information again, you must collect the component in the Object Mapping Mode again. <p>

          <td><img align="BOTTOM" alt="\includegraphics[height=2cm]{lightbulb}" border="0" height="91" src="img2.jpg" width="100" /></td>
          <td><b>Property information can be transient, i.e. it can change as the component or AUT changes. To make sure that you collect the right property, collect the component when it is in the state that you want it to have. A simple example is the color of a component: if you have a component can be green or red and you want to check that it is red, then you should collect it while it is red to see the correct property. </b></td>
