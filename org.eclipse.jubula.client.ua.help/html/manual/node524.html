The location of the component in the AUT hierarchy, the components near to it and the name of the component all play a role in component recognition. For each possible component, the similarity to the originally mapped component is calculated. The component with the highest result is selected. <p> This method makes object mapping generally resilient to changes in the AUT . <p>
