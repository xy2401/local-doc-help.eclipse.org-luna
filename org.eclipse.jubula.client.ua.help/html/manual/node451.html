    <ul>
      <li>To use actions such as <i>replace text</i>, you do not need to worry about using the keyboard - the test execution component does this for you. <li>However, if you would like to press specific buttons on the keyboard such as <tt>&raquo;DONE&laquo;</tt>, <tt>&raquo;DELETE&laquo;</tt> and so on, then you should use the action in the <i>unbound_modules_ios</i> called <i>Tap View with Accessibility Label</i>. <li>This allows you to press any item on the screen (on the keyboard or elsewhere) based on its accessibility label: <ul>
          <li>The accessibility label is an internal attribute for a component that is designed to be used by screen readers etc. <li>You can find out the accessibility label for an item by using the Accessibility Inspector on e.g. an iOS simulator. You can activate the Inspector via the General Settings. <li>Once you know the label, you can enter it as a parameter (exactly as it is written). <li>Bear in mind that accessibility labels are language-dependent (i.e. you will need to translate the test data), and also sometimes orientation-dependent. It is also not necessarily the case that the accessibility label is the same as the text on the item that is visible in the AUT . </ul>
