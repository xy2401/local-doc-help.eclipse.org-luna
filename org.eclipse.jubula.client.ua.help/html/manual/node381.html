    <p><a name="7106"></a><p><span class="textbf">Green border does not appear in Java AUT&#39;s </span><br /> If you are in the Object Mapping Mode and cannot see a green border around components, then this could mean the following: <ul>
        <li>The border cannot be drawn - try collecting the component anyway and see if the technical name appears in the Object Mapping Editor . <li>The component is not supported - find out whether the component in your AUT is a standard component or a custom component. If it is a custom component, you may need to write an extension to be able to test it. </ul>
    <p><span class="textbf">Green border is shown but component cannot be mapped</span><br /> If you can see the green border in the Object Mapping Mode but cannot collect the component, this could mean the following: <p>
      <ul>
        <li>The key combination you are using is being blocked by the AUT - try changing the combination <a href="node307.html#TasksPrefsOMM">3.28.6</a>. <li>The component is already mapped. Check whether a technical name in the <i>unassigned technical names</i> or <i>assigned names</i> category is being highlighted. <li>The component is not supported - find out whether the component in your AUT is a standard component or a custom component. If it is a custom component, you may need to write an extension to be able to test it. </ul>
    <p><span class="textbf">Problems with GTK</span><br /> The GTK graphics toolkit (often used with Linux) can make object mapping with the default settings impossible for certain components. If the AUT that you are mapping is running under Linux, please change the object mapping shortcut key combination to anything <span class="textit">other than</span> <tt>&raquo;CTRL+SHIFT+[0-9 OR A-F]&laquo;</tt>. <p>
