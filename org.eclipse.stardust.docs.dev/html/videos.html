   <h1>Self-Learning Training Videos</h1>
   <p>This section provides an overview of links to a series of self-learning videos
      to learn how to use Stardust. It is recommended to perform the trainings
      of a single learning unit in the presented order.</p>
   <p>Also refer to our 
      <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/stardust/documentation/training-videos.php">
      Self-Learning Trainings</a> Stardust Wiki page.</p>
   <h2>Overview</h2>
   <p>
      Most videos are AVC -- also known as H.264 -- movies in mp4 multimedia containers
      and can be viewed with <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a> player (open
      source and available for all major systems) and Windows Media Player 12 (shipping
      with Windows 7). Older versions of Windows Media Player do not work. Depending on
      your browser configuration they open in a browser window or the media player opens
      in a separate window. The videos are not optimized for streaming and are not
      bandwidth adaptive. For instant viewing a fast connection is necessary. If you have
      a slower connection or plan to view the videos several times, it is recommended that
      you save them to a local location. You do this in most browsers by right-clicking on
      the link and choosing &quot;save target as&quot; or similar.
   </p>
   <h2>Learning Units</h2>
   <h3>Getting Started</h3>
   <p>In this unit you learn the &quot;basics&quot;: How to configure the environment.
      In the second video you learn the setup of a basic project. Eclipse is a very
      powerful and complex development environment, so obviously we cannot give a general
      introduction to Eclipse, but you will learn what you need for starting modeling. In
      the following video, you learn how to create an easy process model in the Business
      Process Management Notation.</p>

   <h3>Modeling</h3>
   <p>Modeling is an important and in most cases the first part in the BPM lifecycle.
      Therefore the second unit starts with a bit more complex modeling after the first
      example in the preceding unit. A scenario to be found in most organizations is a
      helpdesk. While components of a business process - likeroles and various
      organizations - can be demonstrated, the process model is not overly complex.</p>
   <p>Finally we show you the simulation functionality of Stardust in two videos.</p>
   <p>Process simulation allows a process model to be tested for performance
      characteristics without actually deploying the process. Each simulation run is a
      hypothetical (what-if) test that varies parameters such as work volume, worker
      availability, etc. to provide a performance summary of the process design under
      those conditions. Some parameters are set to fixed values. Other parameters are
      allowed to change within a range of possible values just as they would in real life.
      In effect, the simulation run shrinks the scale of real time (weeks, months, years
      etc.) to just a few seconds, minutes or hours to predict long term process behavior
      without the time and cost of actual deployment and observation.</p>

   <h3>End User Portal</h3>
   <p>Most videos are about the Stardust portal functionality, which is offered in a
      unified portal with several perspectives. It replaces the several portals which
      where used until version 5.</p>
   <p>The End User Portal is what the seen by the this type of user, it is the
      interface to the solution. It is highly configurable, which is one of the strengths
      of Stardust. The exact view depends on the process models and on the role of the user. It
      can be configured to adhere to style guidelines of a company. Nevertheless, the look
      &amp; feel on a little more abstract level and usage patterns stay the same.
      Therefore the videos are useful also for end users that work with a solution build
      with the Stardust portal.</p>
