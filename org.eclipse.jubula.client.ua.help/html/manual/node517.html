    <p> There are three levels of components: <dl>
        <dt><strong>Abstract components</strong><dd>are general, high-level components from which other components are derived. They are described in terms of what features a component has, e.g. graphics component, component with text. They group actions together which can all be executed on components of this type. <dt><strong>Concrete components</strong><dd>are components which are available to all graphical toolkits, but which are restricted to a certain component type, e.g. combo box, list. <dt><strong>Toolkit specific components</strong><dd>are the most specific components. They are only available for certain toolkits. For example, a HTML link is a component which is only available in Web applications. </dl>
    <p> We recommend that you specify your tests as abstractly as possible, and as concretely as necessary. If you want to create a Test Case to click a button, it is better to use the abstract component <i>graphics component</i>. The <i>graphics component</i> also contains the <i>click</i> action, and has the advantage that the Test Case can then be used on other components than buttons. If you want to select a cell from a table, however, you will have to use the concrete component <i>table</i>, because this is the highest level which offers this action. <p> The more abstract your specification, the more flexible your Test Cases are. <p>
