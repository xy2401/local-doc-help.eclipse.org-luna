    <p> It is often initially more intuitive to start writing a test in a linear fashion, adding steps as necessary. Each step is specified for the current purpose, and contains all the necessary details (e.g. data). <p> The possible problem with this method is that similar or identical parts are often separately and multiply specified, which means that making changes at a later point can be difficult and time-consuming. <p> To avoid this, you can extract Test Cases from other Test Cases to combine them into reusable modules <a href="node126.html#TasksEditorExtract">3.9.8</a>. <p>
