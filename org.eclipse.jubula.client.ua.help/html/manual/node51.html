    <p><a name="471"></a> <a name="472"></a> If the ITE and AUT Agent are installed on one machine, there are a few things to be aware of: <ul>
        <li>Don&#39;t use the mouse or any keyboard shortcuts during execution. The AUT takes control of the machine it is running on during test execution. <li>Make sure that the AUT is visible during test execution: <ul>
            <li>The ITE is minimized by default when test execution begins. Make sure that the AUT is the next window to receive focus when the ITE is minimized. <li>You can change the preference to minimize the ITE via: <br />
              <table border="0" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">
                <tr>
                  <td bgcolor="#DDDDDD">Window</td>
                  <td>--&gt;</td>
                  <td bgcolor="#DDDDDD">Preferences</td>
                </tr>
              </table>
              <br /> If you do this, make sure that the AUT can also be seen on the screen when test execution begins. </ul>
      </ul>
