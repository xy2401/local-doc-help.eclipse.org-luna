      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Continue with the Event Handler :</strong><dd>Press the &quot;<i>Pause test execution</i>&quot; button on the toolbar <a href="node229.html#PauseExec">3.19.3.3</a> to continue with the test. This will result in a Event Handler (either a default Event Handler or one of your own) being activated. <dt><strong>Continue without Event Handler :</strong><dd>Press the &quot;<i>Continue without Event Handler </i>&quot; button or <tt>&raquo;F8&laquo;</tt> to continue with the test <i>as if the failed Test Step had been successful</i>. No Event Handler is activated. This option is useful if the Event Handler that would be activated would restart the AUT or exit the test, but you are either able to ignore the error for the moment or make changes in the AUT to ensure that the test will be able to continue. </dl>
