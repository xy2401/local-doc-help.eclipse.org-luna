    <h2><a name="SECTION004331000000000000000"> <span class="arabic">3</span>.<span class="arabic">33</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span> Numeric Project Element Counter</a></h2> This metric is in the category <i>Numerical Metrics</i>. <p> This metric counts the amount of items in a Project according to the following rules: <p>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Test Cases :</strong><dd>How many individual Test Cases have been created. <dt><strong>Test Suites :</strong><dd>How many individual Test Suites have been created. <dt><strong>Test Jobs :</strong><dd>How many individual Test Jobs have been created. <dt><strong>Test Steps :</strong><dd>How many individual Test Steps have been created, plus how many Test Steps have been used from any reused Projects . Test Steps are only counted once for the place they are specified (or, in the case of Test Steps from reused Projects , reused). They are not counted transitively (i.e. if a Project contains a Test Case with one Test Step , and this Test Case is reused four times, there is still only one Test Step . <dt><strong>Referenced Test Cases :</strong><dd>How many separate (not transitive) Test Case references there are in the current scope. If a Test Case <i>TC1</i> is reused twice in a Test Case <i>TC2</i>, then the number of reuses for <i>TC1</i> is two, regardless of how many times <i>TC2</i> is reused. <dt><strong>Event Handlers :</strong><dd>How many Event Handlers are used in the current scope. The same rules for non-transitivity apply - if <i>TC1</i> contains an Event Handler , then this Event Handler is only counted once, regardless how many times <i>TC1</i> is reused. <dt><strong>Categories:</strong><dd>How many categories are created in the current scope. Only categories in the Test Case Browser and Test Suite Browser are currently counted. </dl>
    <p> The results are shown in the Search Result View. <p>
