    <p> Obviously, these two approaches lie on a continuum. You can &#39;&#39;mix-and-match&#39;&#39; so that you can choose the approach that works best for you - a combination of the two or one method for one Test Case and the other for another Test Case . <p> For example, if you know that a certain test procedure (e.g. logging in) has to be executed frequently, you can specify a Test Case to do this, and specfiy it to be easily reusable (using references as data-placeholders, and using general component names to be reassigned). For parts of the test which are not likely to be carried out more than once, you can specify them with data and definite component names. <p>
