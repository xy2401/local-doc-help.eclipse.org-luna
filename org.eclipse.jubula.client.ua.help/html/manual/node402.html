Which way you choose will depend on your AUT , build process and Eclipse version, and you should check with the development team which approach is best: <p>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>During the product build:</strong><dd>Adding the RCP Accessor as a plugin to your AUT as it is being built is one way to ensure that it is present and started when the AUT starts. <dt><strong>Via the OSGI console:</strong><dd>If adding the Accessor during the build is not an option, then you can add it after the build via the OSGI console. The availability of this option is dependent on the version of Eclipse you use, and your AUT : It must allow this type of post-hoc inclusion of plugins for this to work. <dt><strong>Via the P2 director:</strong><dd>Alternatively, you can add it after the product build using the P2 director. The availability of this option is dependent on the version of Eclipse you use, and your AUT : It must allow this type of post-hoc inclusion of plugins for this to work. </dl>
