    <h3><a name="SECTION00575800000000000000"> <span class="arabic">4</span>.<span class="arabic">7</span>.<span class="arabic">5</span>.<span class="arabic">8</span> Other important information for testing iOS AUT&#39;s </a></h3><span class="textbf">Non-supported components</span><br /> The following components are not a part of the iOS toolkit, and their actions from the concrete toolkit cannot be used in iOS tests: <ul>
      <li>Menus <li>Tables <li>Trees <li>Context menus </ul>
    <p><span class="textbf">Non-supported actions</span><br /> The following actions are currently not supported: <dl>
        <dt><strong>Take screenshot:</strong><dd>It is currently not possible to take screenshots as a part of the test. Automatic screenshots on errors are, however, produced. <dt><strong>Restart:</strong><dd>The restart action restarts the internal connection to the AUT , not the AUT itself. This means that you should consider how to reset your AUT to a known starting point as part of your Event Handlers (to ensure that the test can continue despite an error). How to do this will be dependent on your AUT . <dt><strong>Check text on secure textfields:</strong><dd>The text on a secure textfield cannot be accessed, e.g. to perform check text. <dt><strong>Check / store property</strong><dd> actions are not supported in the current version. <dt><strong>Application input text</strong><dd> is not supported. Use input text or replace text on <i>Component with Text Input</i> instead. <dt><strong>Copy to clipboard</strong><dd> is currently not supported. </dl>
    <p><span class="textbf">Other information</span><br />
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>No detailed information on test failure:</strong><dd>When a Test Step fails, there is currently no detailed information about the reason for the error. <dt><strong>Support characters for text input:</strong><dd>Any keys on the keyboard that are only accessible by a long press, and not by switching the whole keyboard (e.g. characters with umlauts) cannot currently be entered. <dt><strong>Disabled components</strong><dd> cannot be mapped directly using e.g. tap. Instead, to collect the technical name for a disabled component, you should use the <i>long tap</i> gesture to collect all of the visible components. This includes the disabled components. </dl>
