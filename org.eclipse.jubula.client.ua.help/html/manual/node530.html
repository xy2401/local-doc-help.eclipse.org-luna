    <h2><a name="SECTION007122000000000000000"> <span class="arabic">6</span>.<span class="arabic">12</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span> Default Event Handlers </a></h2> Default Event Handlers are a part of the Test Suite and can be considered as being present at the Test Suite level. They are activated when no Event Handler has been found for the event type in the part of the tree where the error occurred. The default reentry type for each event type can be specified in the Properties View for the Test Suite Editor . <p> The reentry types for the default Event Handlers are the same throughout the tree. Everywhere a certain type of error occurs, the same action will be taken, unless the part of the tree where the error occurred has its own Event Handler for that event type. <p>
