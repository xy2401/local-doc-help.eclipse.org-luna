    <h2><a name="SECTION004334000000000000000"> <span class="arabic">3</span>.<span class="arabic">33</span>.<span class="arabic">4</span> Waits and delays</a></h2> This analysis can be performed on Test Result Reports in the Functional Test Execution Perspective and in the Functional Test Reporting Perspective . Select a node you want to analyze and select: <br />
    <table border="0" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#DDDDDD">Analyze</td>
        <td>--&gt;</td>
        <td bgcolor="#DDDDDD">Waits and delays</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br /> from the context-sensitive menu. <p> The analysis examines the selected node and the nodes below it in the Test Result Report for all instances where a wait is performed. This can be the action &quot;<i>Wait</i>&quot; or it could also be the parameters &quot;<i>Delay after...</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>Delay before...</i>&quot;. Basically, any time a static wait (i.e. not a timeout) is performed, then this is analyzed. <p> You can define a parameter for the analysis which specifies the minimum value of waits to be analyzed (in milliseconds). If you enter e.g. 5000, then only waits above 5000ms will be shown in the results. <p> Once the results have been calculated, they are shown in the Search Result View. They are organized according to the action that the wait is contained in. The amount of waits corresponding to each action is shown in brackets behind the action name. On the right hand side of the Search Result View, the cumulative values for the amount of waits for each action are shown. The number on the left is the total amount of waits that correspond to the parameter value entered. The number on the right shows the total amount of waits for this action, regardless of the parameter. In this way, it is easier to see whether your tests have a few very large waits, or many smaller waits. <p>
