When you work on a task, you only see items relevant to that task, so that coming back to the task later involves less context-switching. <ul>
      <li>Mylyn supports context-based working. You can work on existing tasks in a configured repository, or you can create tasks to work on. <li>To work on a task, you must <i>activate</i> it. To activate a task, select the task in the <i>Task List</i> and select: <br />
        <table border="0" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">
          <tr>
            <td bgcolor="#DDDDDD">Activate</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <br /> from the context-sensitive menu. <li>When you activate a task for the first time, the browsers and editors will seem very empty. This is because nothing is yet a part of the context for this task. <li>You can navigate through the browsers by pressing <tt>&raquo;ALT+CLICK&laquo;</tt> to expand each level, or you can press the <i>Focus on task</i> button in the browsers to show the whole tree (not focusing on the task), or just the items in the current context (focusing on the task). <li>Items are automatically added to your context when you select them in a browser, when you open them in an editor, or when you perform other actions that cause them to be made relevant (e.g. Test Case creation, showing a Test Case specification etc.). Items that are used particularly frequently are marked as <i>landmarks</i> and shown in bold. <li>You can manually alter which items are in your context using the context-sensitive menu for a specific item. You can manually make items landmarks, or remove them from the context. <li>The context that is created for you will be re-created when you reactivate the task at a later point. </ul>
