<h2>What's New in Luna</h2>
<p>Here are descriptions of some of the changes of interest to plug-in developers
made to the Eclipse <a href="#Platform">Platform</a>, <a href="#Equinox">Equinox</a> and
<a href="#SWT">SWT</a> for the Luna (4.4) release of Eclipse.
</p>

<p>
New features oriented towards end-users of the platform
can be viewed in the 
<a href="../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/whatsNew/platform_whatsnew.html">What's new</a>
section of the Workbench User Guide.

    <td class="title">Contribute e4 Views into the IDE</td>
    <td class="content">
      Native e4 views can now be contributed to the Eclipse workbench via extension point.
      The <code>org.eclipse.ui.views</code> extension point now supports an <code>e4view</code>
      element for declaring a new view for the IDE whose implementation
      is done in the e4 style (i.e. an annotated POJO).
      <p>
        <img src="images/new-e4view-extension.png" alt="new extension"/>
      </p><p>
        The new type of extension is identical to the original 'view' except for relaxing the
        requirement that the 'class' implement IViewPart.
      </p><p>
        For those that are unaware of the e4 way of coding, here's what the implementation of an e4 view
        looks like:
      </p>
      <pre>
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import org.eclipse.e4.ui.di.Focus;
import org.eclipse.swt.SWT;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Composite;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Label;

public class RealE4View {
	Label label;

	@PostConstruct
	void createView(Composite parent) {
		label = new Label(parent, SWT.BORDER);	
		label.setText("Testing");
	}

	@Focus
	void setFocus() {
		label.setFocus();
	}
}
      </pre>
      <p>
        Note how it's a simple Java object (POJO) and how few dependencies it has; this has 
        already proven itself as a far more convenient way to write the code and has great 
        advantages in testing (because of its few dependencies).

  <tr id="css-bridge"> 
    <td class="title">CSS bridge</td>
    <td class="content">
      The Eclipse 4 CSS-based styling engine has been connected to the classic Eclipse platform theme APIs through a new
      mechanism called the <i>CSS bridge</i>. This support enables a number of new user cases:
	 <ul>
		<li>
		  Accessing legacy platform <b>Color and Font</b> definitions from within a CSS style sheet:
			<p>
				<img src="images/css-bridge/using-definitions.png" alt=""/>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Overriding <b>Color and Font</b> definitions in a CSS style sheet:
			<p>
				<img src="images/css-bridge/overriding-definitions.png" alt=""/>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		  Adding new style definitions within your CSS that will be surfaced for user customization on the <b>Color and Font</b>
		  preference page:
			<p>
				<img src="images/css-bridge/new-definitions.png" alt=""/>
			</p>
		</li>
	 </ul>
	 This bridging has a number of nice properties:
	 <ul>
	 	<li>The legacy color theme definitions overridden or added in the CSS style sheet are merged with the current theme.</li>
	 	<li>When switching themes, overridden values are re-merged with the new theme.</li>
	 	<li>The new definitions added with the CSS file (the last use case) are available in the CSS theme that provides it.</li>
	 </ul>
	 Note that after switching CSS themes, the definitions can be unavailable in the theme registries when the new theme doesn't re-define it.
	 This means when using theme definitions out of CSS files, you must be prepared for such situations and use proper default values in 
	 the case when some definitions are missing.

	  externally about a changed Locale, the <code>MLocalizable</code> mixin interface is introduced, which contains the single method

	  This enables application authors to change how ResourceBundles should be looked up within their Eclipse application, e.g. using class-based 
	  ResourceBundles, loading translations out of a database, loading ResourceBundles from a server by using a different ResourceBundle.Control.
	  The default implementation <code>DefaultResourceBundleProvider</code> is internally using <code>BundleLocalization</code> to keep the
	  known default behaviour.

  <tr id="TranslationService">
    <td class="title">TranslationService update</td>
    <td class="content">
      The <code>TranslationService</code>, that is used to localize the application model, had several downsides regarding extensibility.
	  A lot of code needed to be copied in order to create a custom <code>TranslationService</code> that retrieves translations from a different location 
	  than the OSGi-ResourceBundle. To make it easier for users to implement a custom <code>TranslationService</code>, the API was modified. The method 
	  <code>getResourceString(String, ResourceBundle)</code> is moved from <code>BundleTranslationProvider</code> to <code>TranslationService</code> with 
	  protected visibility, as it contains the logic to retrieve and transform the translation key that is set in the application model. The default
	  implementation <code>BundleTranslationProvider</code> is now using the <code>ResourceBundleHelper</code> in combination with the 
	  <code>ResourceBundleProvider</code>. This way the localization of the application model and the localization via new message extension are using 
	  the same mechanisms. As a small enhancement, this also enables the usage of dot separated keys for translating the application model.
	  <p>
	  As part of this work, the previously internal package <code>org.eclipse.e4.core.services.translation</code> has been released as API.

      <ul>
         <li> Introduction of Service Scopes to the OSGi Service Registry

         </li>
         <li> Native environment namespace

         </li>
      </ul>
      From an Equinox perspective these are considered incremental enhancements.
      A majority of the development effort during this release cycle is focused on refactoring and, in
      many cases, rewriting the core Equinox Framework implementation to be based on
      the OSGi generic dependency model.
      <p>
      For most consumers and developers this change should not be noticed.  But, as
      documented in the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/Luna_Framework">wiki</a>,
      there are four main areas of concern that the community should be aware of:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>The Framework no longer uses the old Equinox resolver API
             org.eclipse.osgi.service.resolver internally to resolve bundles.</li>
         <li>All Equinox Framework specific hook implementations are broken and will
             need to migrate.</li>
         <li>Removal of old style plug-in support. A compatibility fragment is available to add the support back.</li>

       coming in the OSGi R6 specification.
      This allows Equinox Regions to insert its isolation model before
      the framework is launched so that proper region behavior can be
      established before any bundles are loaded in the framework.
      <p>
      The Equinox Regions has added a new namespace for sharing bundle lifecycle 
      operations between regions.  In previous versions of Equinox regions the only way 
      to share bundle lifecycle operations across different regions was to share complete
      bundles which also shared all capabilities provided by the bundle.  Now it is
      possible to use the org.eclipse.equinox.allow.bundle.lifecycle namespace to share
      only the bundle lifecycle operations between different regions.

        SWT has added two new events, <code>SWT.Sleep</code> and <code>SWT.Wakeup</code>,
        which are sent before the <code>Display</code> event loop goes into sleep and after
        it wakes up from sleep respectively. These events can e.g. be used to monitor the duration
        of sleep time in SWT applications.

      The <code>StyledText</code> widget now supports setting the text direction via the

      The GTK+ 3 support can however still be enabled either by setting the environment variable 
      <code>SWT_GTK3</code> to <code>1</code> or by adding the launcher parameters <code>--launcher.GTK_version 3</code>.

      to 1. This is only supported with GTK+ 3.x; if GTK+ 3 is disabled the browser will 
      fallback to WebKit1.
