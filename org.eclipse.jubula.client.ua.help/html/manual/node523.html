    <h2><a name="SECTION00793000000000000000"> <span class="arabic">6</span>.<span class="arabic">9</span>.<span class="arabic">3</span> Assigning technical names to component names</a></h2> Once you have collected the technical names from the AUT , you can &#39;&#39;assign&#39;&#39; them to the component names using drag-and-drop. In this way, you are telling your test which real component you are referring to in each Test Step . <p> The fact that the object map is separate from the specification means that any changes that need to be made to update a test only need to be made once. <p>
