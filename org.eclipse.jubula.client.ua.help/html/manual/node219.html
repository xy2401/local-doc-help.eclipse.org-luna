The color of the dot corresponds to the strength of the component recognition for this component <i>at the time of collecting</i>. <p>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>A green dot</strong><dd>signifies that the component can be found as an exact match, and that only this component was above the threshold <a href="node210.html#TasksOMConfiguration">3.18.2.4</a> (i.e. only this component was considered as possible. <dt><strong>A yellow dot</strong><dd>means that the component can be found as an exact match, but that other components were also above the threshold, i.e. this was not the only component considered possible. <dt><strong>A red dot</strong><dd>means that the component can not currently be found if a test is executed. The recognition value for the component is below the current threshold. </dl>
    <p> You can use this information to identify components that will not be recognized in the current state of the AUT before running the test. <p>

          <td><b>The colored dot disappears after saving. It is not a measurement of the component state over time, but only at the moment when the component was collected. You can see how well each component was actually located during a test by looking in the test result reports. Each Test Step provides information on the match heuristic for each component.</b></td>
