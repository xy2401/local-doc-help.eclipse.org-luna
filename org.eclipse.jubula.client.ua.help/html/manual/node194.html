    <p> To be able to test multiple AUT&#39;s that are <i>not</i> started by each other, the following criteria must be met: <p>
      <ul>
        <li>The AUT&#39;s are either written with the same toolkit (e.g. Swing) or, <li>you have specified your Project at the <i>concrete</i> level, and will only be testing areas of the AUT&#39;s that can be tested with the actions that are valid for all AUT types (i.e. no RCP-specific components are involved in the test) <a href="node57.html#projtoolkit">7</a>. <li>The AUT&#39;s are all defined in the same Project . <li>The first AUT can either be started using the <i>autrun</i> command <a href="node92.html#autrun">3.7.4.6</a> or via an AUT configuration <a href="node82.html#configuringaut">3.7.1</a>. Any other AUT&#39;s required for the Test Job must have been started with the <i>autrun</i> command. </ul>
    <p>

          <td><b>To run Test Jobs from the test executor, all AUT&#39;s for the test run must already be started when the test execution begins. For unattended build and test processes, this will mean that the AUT&#39;s must be started with the <i>autrun</i> command.</b></td>
