    <p> You can use the advanced dialog to enter the browser path for your browser. This lets you use a specific version of the browser (not available for Internet Explorer). <p> You can also specify whether you want to be able to use the multi-window support in your tests for this AUT . If your AUT has functions that open new windows, then deactivate the <i>Single Window Mode</i> checkbox. Any AUT&#39;s that are running in multi-window mode show the Selenium console as well as the AUT when the AUT is started. The Object Mapping Editor for multi-window AUT&#39;s has a button to allow switching between multiple open windows for mapping components, and there are actions in the HTML unbound modules to allow you to switch between windows during the test. <p> For information on the expert properties for the HTML AUT configuration, see the next section <a href="node102.html#ExpertAUTConfigHTML">3.7.6.3</a>. <p>
