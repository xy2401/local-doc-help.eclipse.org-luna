      <ul>
        <li>the name with which the component was propagated has been changed, or <li>the checkbox to propagate the component name has been deactivated. </ul> In such situations, you will see the message in the Component Names View : <br /><i>No Component Type Exists!</i>. <p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><img align="BOTTOM" alt="\includegraphics[height=2cm]{lightbulb}" border="0" height="91" src="img2.jpg" width="100" /></td>
          <td><b>Saving the Test Case will remove the message, however, you may want to take steps to transfer the component name before removing the message.</b></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>An example of a situation where this occurs: <ol>
            <li>You have a Test Case <i>TC1</i> that has a component name propagated from it: <i>nn_nn_grc</i>. <li>You reused the <i>TC1</i> Test Case in another Test Case called <i>TC2</i>, and renamed the component name to <i>LoginDialog_OK_btn</i> at the place of reuse. <li>You then either: <br />
              <ul>
                <li>change the component name in the original Test Case to &quot;<i>LoginDialog_AnyButton_btn</i>&quot;, <li>or you deactivate the checkbox for propagating the component name from the original Test Case . </ul>
          </ol>
        <li>In the Component Names View for the reused Test Case in <i>TC2</i>, you will see a warning message that the component name has no type. <table>
            <tr>
              <td><img align="BOTTOM" alt="\includegraphics[height=2cm]{danger}" border="0" height="89" src="img1.jpg" width="102" /></td>
              <td><b>The warning field is not editable.</b></td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        <li>Depending on whehter you renamed the component name or removed the checkbox, you can now do one of two things: <ul>
            <li>If you renamed the component name in the original Test Case (<i>TC1</i>, then you can locate the newly propagated name in the Component Names View and enter the <i>new name</i> for the no longer existent component type in the <i>new name</i> field for the newly propagated name. This essentially points the previous component name hierarchy onto the new one. <li>If you deactivated the checkbox, or if you do not want to transfer the name as mentioned above, you can simply make any change to the Test Case and then save it. The message will disappear. </ul>
      </ul>
