<h2 id="intro">Declarative Authorization via Model Elements and
Roles</h2>
<p>In addition to implicit permissions like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>permission to start a process via manual trigger</li>
	<li>permission to activate and complete an activity via performer
	assignment</li>
	<li>general administrative permissions for the Administrator role</li>
</ul>
<p>for the runtime other permissions are specified on model elements
and assigned to a role or organization.</p>
<p>These permissions are evaluated for runtime instances of the
model elements. Furthermore, read and modification permissions can be
specified for model elements themselves. All permissions, even those to
access model elements in the modeling environment, can be controlled by
assigning users to appropriate roles through the directory service (e.g.
LDAP, MS Active Directory, Stardust internal user database). Note, that
permissions cannot be assigned to conditional performers.</p>
<p>To get an overview over permissions used in the Stardust Services
API, refer to the chapter <a
	href="../programming/embed/pg-declarative-security.html"> Declarative
Security Usage in Stardust Services API</a> of the <a
	href="../programming/pg-preface.htm">Programming Guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Enable Security Check</h3>
<p>To make declarative security effective, make sure that the
according service guarded property (<a
	href="../operation/properties/ag-appendix-properties-1.htm#queryGuarded"><i>xxx</i>Service.Guarded</a>)
is set to <tt>true</tt> (default value).</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong><br>
It is not recommended to change this property.
Changing the value to <tt>false</tt> introduces a high risk of 
executing services without having a permission and 
hence might cause a severe security hole in the deployment!</p>
<h2 id="relation">Influence of Organizational Relations on
Declarative Security</h2>
<p>In case a declarative security grant is modeled for an
organization, it is implicitly granted for all users having grants for
one or more roles or organizations with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
	<li>an organization is a direct or indirect "Part Of" this
	organization.</li>
	<li>a role has a "Works For" association to a role being a direct
	or indirect "Part Of" this organization.</li>
	<li>a role has a "Manager Of" association to a role being a direct
	or indirect "Part Of" this organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>For example in the following organizational structure, whenever a
declarative security grant is modeled for the organization <strong>O1</strong>,
it will implicitly be granted for all users having grants for
organization <strong>O3</strong>, <strong>O2</strong> and the roles <strong>Role
2</strong> and <strong>R1</strong>.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/declarative-security-example.png"
	alt="Organizational Structure"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Example Organizational Structure</p>
<h2 id="scoped">Declarative Security in a Scoped Environment</h2>
<p>The effect of authorization set for scoped participants
depends on the model element:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#dataL">Data</a></li>
	<li><a href="#actL">Activities</a></li>
	<li><a href="#process">Process Definitions</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dataL">Data</h4>
<p>If a grant is given to a scoped participant for a data element,
then all users assigned to this participant do have execution permission. 
The department is not taken into account.</p>
<h4 id="actL">Activities</h4>
<p>Each activity instance stores the department information. 
Thus, it depends on the concrete activity instance, if a user has execution 
permission. In that case, the grant including the department has to match the 
grant permission and the department of the activity instance.</p>
<h4 id="processL">Process Definitions</h4>
<p>Department information is not stored in the process instance. 
Instead, the relevant process data defining the department
is evaluated on demand.</p>
<p>For example, a process definition permission is granted to a 
role <strong>Role 1</strong>. This role is a scoped role with scope data 
<strong>Data 1</strong> defining the department. If the value of 
<strong>Data 1</strong> is
executed for a specific process instance, the department required to
get the execution permission is evaluated.</p>

<h2 id="prop">Setting Authorization in Model Element Property Pages</h2>
<p>You can set authorization in the property dialogs of the
following model elements:</p>
<ul>
<!-- 	<li><a href="#data">data</a></li> -->
	<li><a href="#process">process definitions</a></li>
	<li><a href="#activities">activities</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the <strong>Permission</strong> part, all permissions possible
for the element are listed. Beneath this list, the possible participants
for a selected permission are displayed with checkboxes. Possible
participants are all roles, organizations, the administrator and the
participant pertaining to an activity (<strong>Owner</strong>).
Additionally the <strong>All</strong> option is provided to give grant
to everyone. Grants like <strong>Owner</strong> and <strong>All</strong>,
not pertaining to specific participants, are displayed cursive.</p>
<p>The permission set by default, is also enabled per default in the
dialog. It is marked as <tt>default</tt> in brackets after the grant
name.</p>
<p>To remove permission from all participants, deselect all provided
entries.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong><br>
Be aware that if disabling all permissions and closing the dialog, the
permission is reset to the default permission and persisted again. After
reopening the dialog you notice the default permission selected again.</p>
<p>Please also refer to the section <a href="#security">Overwriting
default Values of Declarative Security Grants</a> for details on overwriting
default values.</p>
<h3>Setting Authorization Properties</h3>
<p>To set the authorization in the properties dialog of an element:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the property page select <strong>Authorization</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Authorization</strong> pane you see a list with
	the permissions possible for the element.</li>
	<li>Beneath this list, the possible participants for a selected
	permission are displayed with checkboxes. Enable the checkbox for the
	participant to give the permission to.</li>
</ul>
<p>If no participant is selected, the permission is given to the
default participant provided for this action. The administrator is
always granted, regardless of the grants set for the authorization
property.</p>

<strong>Figure:</strong> Setting the Authorization for a non-interactive
Activity.</p>
<h4>Delegation to other departments</h4>
<p>The entitlement <strong>Delegation to other departments</strong>
allows the user to delegate work from one department to another.</p>
<h4>Delegation to other users vs. Delegation to other departments</h4>
<p>To determine if an activity delegation succeeds with the
"Delegation to other users" permission, or requires the "Delegation to
other departments" permission, depends on the following cases. In case
the input for delegation is:</p>
<ol>
	<li>the source participant, represented by a source participant
	and a source department</li>
	<li>the target participant, represented by a target participant
	and a target department</li>
	<li>the default performer of the activity, represented by a
	participant</li>
</ol>
<p>then the delegation permissions needed are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Delegation is only allowed if both, the source and target
	participant are children of the default participant.</li>
	<li>In case the source and target department share the same parent
	department at default participant level, the delegation only requires
	the "Delegation to other users" permission.</li>
	<li>If the source and target department do not share the same
	parent department at default participant level, the delegation requires
	the "Delegation to other departments" permission.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="interactive">Interactive activities</h4>
<p>Interactive activities additionally can have the grant <strong>Owner</strong>,
which represents the participant associated with the activity. This is
useful for example to restrict the abort functionality for subprocess
activities. Thus it can be avoided that subprocess activities are
aborted and as a consequence the whole process is terminated.</p>
<p>If the activity instance is in the participant worklist of a
scoped participant, the <strong>Owner</strong> grant is extended to the
worklist visibilities. The participant and department of the activity
will then have to match with the logged-in user in order to allow the
action.</p>

<p>The property pages for interactive activities provide the
following permissions and default participant settings:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th width="270">Permission</th>

<h3 id="prePerm">Predefined Permissions</h3>
<p>Please refer to chapter <a
	href="../operation/ag-appendix-security-1.htm#applPermission">Setting
Application Permissions</a> of chapter <a
	href="../operation/ag-appendix-security-1.htm">Securing the
Stardust Engine</a> in the <a href="../operation/ag-preface.htm">Operation
Guide</a> for information on how to use service operations provided by
Stardust to set permissions.</p>
<h3 id="permEv">Permission Evaluation</h3>
<p>The permissions will be evaluated at modeling and runtime and
will be granted or rejected according to the following two categories:</p>
<ul>
	<li>For single operations a permission is rejected, an exception
	is thrown to be the invoked service (e.g. model deployment)</li>
	<li>For operations obtaining data requiring permission (e.g.
	retrieving a list of activity instances) the permission is evaluated
	and applied against the returned value set which may be empty because
	of restricted permission of the logged-in user. No exception is thrown
	for this category.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="permissionRet">Permission Retrieval</h3>
<p>Permissions for logged-in users can be retrieved at runtime for
all services via the following specific service operation:</p>
<pre>List getPermissions()</pre>
<p>These permissions might be used to control for example enabling
or disabling of GUI controls. Please refer to the chapter <a
	href="../programming/embed/proc-act-inst/pg-embed-permission.html">Retrieving and Using
Permission States</a> of the <a href="../programming/pg-preface.htm">Programming
Guide</a> for detailed information on permission retrieval via API.</p>
<h2 id="security">Overwriting Default Values of Declarative
Security Grants</h2>
<p>Declarative grant default values are configurable at runtime by
setting the following configuration parameters in your server-side <tt>carnot.properties</tt>
file:</p>
<ul>
	<li>StardustBpm.Engine.Authorization.DefaultPermissions.ActivityInstance.Abort</li>
	<li>StardustBpm.Engine.Authorization.DefaultPermissions.ProcessInstance.Abort</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows to overwrite the default values (empty value, <strong>OWNER</strong>)
of the declarative grants for activity instance abortion and process
instance abortion respectively. As values you can set the ID of a role
or organization pertaining to the process model or a predefined meta
role like <strong>ALL</strong> or <strong>OWNER</strong>. The value can
contain a comma-separated list. Note that no whitespaces like spaces or
tabs are allowed between the listed items.</p>
<p>For example, setting</p>
<pre>StardustBpm.Engine.Authorization.DefaultPermissions.ActivityInstance.Abort = Engineer,Developer</pre>
<p>will change the grant of the <strong>Abort Activity
Instance</strong> to the roles with ID <tt>Engineer</tt> and <tt>Developer</tt>.</p>
<p>Setting</p>
<pre>StardustBpm.Engine.Authorization.DefaultPermissions.ProcessInstance.Abort = ALL</pre>
<p>would change the grant of <strong>Abort Process Instance</strong>
to all model roles and organizations.</p>
