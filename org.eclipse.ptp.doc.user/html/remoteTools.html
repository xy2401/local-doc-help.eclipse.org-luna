<p>
<b><i>Remote Tools is replaced in PTP 8.0 (Eclipse Luna) with a built-in SSH (JSch) remote services provider.</i></b>
<p>Remote Tools is now deprecated; the information here is now provided for managing connections with <b>Built-in SSH</b>.
<p>&nbsp;
<p>
To access the remote target system, PTP supports a number of
<i>remote service providers</i>. 
Currently supported remote service providers include <b>Built-in SSH</b> (part of PTP, implemented via JSch).
<b>Remote Tools</b> (lightweight remote support originally part of PTP) is now deprecated.
PTP also supports 
the <b>Eclipse Remote Systems Explorer (RSE)</b> which is an optional package that can be installed. 
<b>The preferred remote service provider is Built-in SSH</b> which supports all the PTP and Remote Development Tools (RDT) 
functionality, however
some installations use additional features that are only available in RSE. 
Most PTP information is described using <b>Built-in SSH</b>, since it is the simplest and easiest to use.</p>

projects.

<h2 id="create">Creating Remote Connections</h2>
<p>New connections are typically created when a need for them arises, such as creating a remote or synchronized
project, or a run configuration on a remote target machine. 
<ul>
<li>You can also create a new connection independently via the <b>Preferences</b> page.  See 
<a href="#edit">Edit</a> below and use the <b>Add </b> button on the <b>Preferences</b> page.
</ul>
To create a new connection to a remote machine, e.g. when creating a <a href="sync.html">synchronized project</a>, 
the new connection information is specified as part of the <b>New Synchronized Project</b> dialog.
<p>

<p>
Select <b>New...</b> and on the <b>New Connection</b> dialog, specify a Connection name
of your choice. Fill in user name and password. Select
<b>Finish</b> to create the connection.

<h2 id="tunnel">SSH tunneling</h2>
<p>See the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/PTP/FAQ#Q:_How_do_I_use_PTP_to_connect_to_a_remote_system_via_an_intermediate_host_.28multi_hop.29">
PTP Wiki FAQ on tunneling</a> for how to set up the tunnel.
For example, pick an unused port > 1024 such as 7373 in this example:
<pre>
ssh -L 7373:&lt;target-host&gt;:22 &lt;intermediate-userid&gt;@&lt;intermediate-host&gt;
</pre>

<p>Then in the connection dialog, expand the <b>Advanced </b> section and use the same port number that you specified
from the command line ssh command.
<p>

<!--   -->
<h2 id="edit">Editing Remote Connections</h2>
<p>To edit remote connection information after a connection is created, e.g. to change userid, password, etc.,
open the Eclipse <b>Preferences</b> dialog (Window>Preferences, or on Mac, Eclipse>Preferences).

(The Remote Environments view, supported in PTP 7.0 and previous, is no longer used.)

<p>Within the Preferences dialog, select the <b>Remote Development>Connections</b> section.

<p><img src="images/prefs_remoteDevConnections.png">
 

<p>To edit a connection, it must first be closed if it is open(running).  To close a connection, select it and use the <b>Close</b>
button.

<p>Once stopped, edit the connection via the <b>Edit</b> button.

<p>Then make any changes to the connection and select <b>Finish</b>
<p><img src="images/rt_editConnection.png">
<p>The connection need not be manually restarted (re-opened).  It will automatically open the next
time that communication with the target machine is needed.


<p>
<!--   -->
<h2 id="remove">Removing Remote Connections</h2>
<p>To remove a connection, select it in the <b>Connections</b> page of the Preferences page as described above, 
and select <b>Remove</b>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2 id="shell">Shell access to Remote systems</h2>
<p>For convenient shell access to a remote system within an Eclipse view, see <a href="remoteTerminal.html">Remote Terminal</a>.

<h2 id="default">Default Remote Services Provider</h2>
<p>By default, <b>Built-in SSH</b> should be configured to be the default provider and the user should
not have to specify which Remote Service Provider to use.
<p>Preferences > Remote Development can be used to override the default selection if desired.
<p><img src="images/prefs_remoteDev.png">
<!-- - need more info here -->
<h2 id="local">Local Connections</h2>

<p>Previous versions of PTP required an ssh connection back to the local machine in order
to launch a parallel application on the local machine.  Now you need only specify <b>Local</b>
for the connection type in the launch configuration.  No "connection" is required.
