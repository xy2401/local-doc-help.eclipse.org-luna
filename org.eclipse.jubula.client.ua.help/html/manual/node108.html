Instead, the AUT must have been made testable <a href="node436.html#ToolkitiOSSetup">4.7.2</a>, had component naming added <a href="node441.html#ToolkitiOSDFT">4.7.3</a> and also be started on the simulator or device that it will be tested on. Once these prerequisites have been completed, you can connect to the AUT from the ITE by selecting the AUT from the list in the &quot;<i>Start AUT </i>&quot; button on the toolbar. This does not start the AUT but connects to it. <p>
