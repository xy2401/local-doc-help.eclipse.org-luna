Once you have done this, you can remove the unnecessary column from the central test data set. <p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><img align="BOTTOM" alt="\includegraphics[height=2cm]{danger}" border="0" height="89" src="img1.jpg" width="102" /></td>
          <td><b>In order to perform this action, all Test Cases to be changed must not be in use by anyone else using the Project - you should ensure that this is the case before performing the action, otherwise the action cannot be carried out.</b></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Search for all places where the central test data set whose column usage you want to change is used. Use <i>Show where used</i> on the central test data set to see all places <a href="node319.html#TasksShowWhereUsedDataSet">3.29.4</a>. <li>In the Search Result View , you will see all places where the selected central test data set is reused in this Project , including any original specifications of Test Cases that use it, and any reused Test Cases that use it (as Test Cases or as Event Handlers . We recommend selecting all entries to perform the action, otherwise you may have incomplete test data after only changing a subset. <li>You will only be able to perform the changes if: <ul>
            <li>All the selected Test Cases use the same central test data set. <li>All the selected Test Cases have their original specification in this Project , i.e. you do not have a Test Case from a reused Project that uses the central test data set in this Project . <li>The Project is not protected. <li>The Test Cases you have selected are present (i.e. they are not missing from e.g. reused Projects . <li>None of the selected Test Cases uses two different central test data sets (e.g. one central test data set on the originally specified Test Case , and another one at a place where it is reused). <li>The selected Test Cases have at least one referenced parameter and at least one of the referenced parameters has the same type as another parameter in the central test data set. </ul>
        <li>If the Project is protected, or Test Cases are missing, the context-menu entry will be disabled. If any of the other prerequisites are not fulfilled, you will see an information dialog that lets you automatically deselect any invalid Test Cases . <li>From the context menu, select: <br />
          <table border="0" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">
            <tr>
              <td bgcolor="#DDDDDD">Change central test data set column usage</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br />
        <li>In the dialog that appears, you can select a parameter to change on the left-hand side, and the column to change it to on the right-hand side. You can only change the usage of columns whose types are the same. If you have e.g. TEXT1 (string) and TEXT2 (string) in your central test data set and Test Cases , but you only require TEXT1, then select TEXT2 on the left-hand side and TEXT1 on the right hand side. <li>Click &quot;<i>Finish</i>&quot; to perform the action. <li>All selected Test Cases will be altered to use the newly chosen column in place of the previously used column. <li>If the newly chosen column was already used in one or more of the selected Test Cases , then all places within the Test Case that referenced the old column are changed to reference the newly chosen column. Using the example from above, all places where TEXT2 was referenced in the selected Test Case will be changed to TEXT1. The changed name remains at the interface of the Test Case ; TEXT2 is not deleted from the Test Case , but it is no longer used. If the newly chosen column was not yet used in one or more of the selected Test Cases , the old parameter name of the Test Case is renamed to the newly chosen column. </ol>
