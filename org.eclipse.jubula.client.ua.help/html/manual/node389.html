        <li>When you stop the AUT Agent , any AUT&#39;s that were connected to this AUT Agent are closed. <li>AUT&#39;s which were started from a configuration are automatically closed when the test execution via the test executor stops. <li>To stop the AUT manually, select the AUT you want to stop from the Running AUT&#39;s View and then click the Stop AUT button. <br />
          <div class="margin"><img align="BOTTOM" alt="Image stopAUT" border="0" height="256" src="./stopAUT.png" width="256" />&nbsp; stop AUT </div>
          <br />
        <li>A dialog will appear to ask you if you are sure you want to stop the AUT . Click &quot;<i>yes</i>&quot;. <li>You can opt to not see this dialog in the preferences <a href="node301.html#gdprefs">3.30</a>. </ol>
    <p><span class="textbf">Stopping an AUT in a test</span><br /> Stopping an AUT as part of a test is generally not possible. The AUT will be stopped automatically at the end of testing according to the points mentioned above. <p> You can use the <i>restart</i> action to restart the AUT during the test. You may be able to use the action <i>External Key Combination</i> to send an unconfirmed keystroke to the AUT (i.e. <tt>&raquo;ENTER&laquo;</tt> on a prompt dialog for closing the AUT ) to close the AUT at the end of your test, however, the success of this is dependent on the AUT and environment as well as timing and synchronization issues. <p>
