These include, but are not limited to: clicking, checking, entering text and selecting. <p><span class="textbf">Actions not (yet) implemented</span><dl>
        <dt><strong>Drag and Drop</strong><dd>
        <dt><strong>Using row headers for table selection:</strong><dd>Unlike other supported toolkits, Windows AUT&#39;s have integrated row headers in tables. These are not yet supported. When using the actions <i>Select Value from Row</i> and <i>Select Cell</i>, the row can therefore only be selected using its index. It is not possible to enter the value in the first column to identify the row as is the case in other toolkits. <dt><strong>Combo box: Check selection of entry by index:</strong><dd>This action will not be implemented for Windows AUT&#39;s , as the dropdown list needs to be opened to access the list items. If text is already in the text field of the combo box when it is opened, then the first item that matches the entered text is selected - this may change the selected item and therefore the index. <dt><strong>Combo box: Relative selection:</strong><dd>For the same reason as above, only the value <i>absolute</i> is supported for selections by value from the combo box. <dt><strong>Trees: Multiselection:</strong><dd>As WinForms does not support true multiselection for Trees, any actions used to test the multiselection of a Tree will fail. <dt><strong>Deprecated actions:</strong><dd>Any actions marked as <i>deprecated</i> have not been implemented. <dt><strong>Show Text</strong><dd>
        <dt><strong>Editability checks for tables:</strong><dd>The actions for check editability on a whole table, or on individual cells within it, are not supported in the current version. <dt><strong>Checking the text of password fields:</strong><dd>The contents of password fields cannot be checked in tests for Windows AUT&#39;s , as the Windows RC does not run in the same process as the AUT itself. Such checks on password fields will always fail with a Check Failed error. </dl>
