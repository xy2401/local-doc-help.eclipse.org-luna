<h2>What's New in Luna</h2>
<p>Here are descriptions of some of the more interesting or significant changes 
made to the Eclipse Platform for the Luna (4.4) release of Eclipse.</p>
<p>
Plug-in developers will also be interested in the corresponding 
<a href="../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/whatsNew/platform_isv_whatsnew.html">What's new</a>
document in the plug-in developer's guide.

    <td class="title">Split editors</td>
    <td class="content">Do you ever find yourself working in a large file and need to view or edit multiple sections at once?
     <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8009" target="_blank">Finally</a>, Eclipse supports split editors!
     You can now split / unsplit the currently active editor. Just use one of the new key bindings supplied in Luna:
     <ul>
     <li><b>Ctrl+_</b> splits the editor one above the other</li>
     <li><b>Ctrl+{</b> splits the editor side by side</li>
     <li>Re-applying the command to an already split editor reverts it to only have one pane.</li>
     </ul>

    <p>Try it out on <i>your</i> favorite editor!</p>

  <tr id="darktheme">
    <td class="title">Dark theme</td>
    <td class="content">
      A new dark window theme has been introduced. This popular community theme demonstrates the power of the underlying 
      Eclipse 4 styling engine. You can enable it from the <b>General &gt; Appearance</b> preference page. Plug-ins can contribute
      extensions to this theme to style their own specific views and editors to match the window theme.

    <td class="title">Quick access as a popup</td>
    <td class="content">
      If you find the <b>Quick Access</b> field in the toolbar takes up too much space, you can now hide it.
      From the context menu in the toolbar, select <b>Hide</b>.
      <p><img src="images/quick-access-hide.png" alt="Hiding quick access"/></p>
      <p>Once hidden, pressing <b>Ctrl+3</b> will instead show a popup dialog.</p>

  <tr id="minimized-stack-option"> 
    <td class="title">New layout for minimized views</td>
    <td class="content">
    Minimized views now have two different display modes:
    <ul>
    <li>Use Overlays: This is the current mode where showing a minimized view 
    opens it in a 'fly out', overlaying part of the main window.</li>
    <li>Show in the Original Location: This is a new mode that will temporarily put the
    stack back into the perspective while one of its views is active. This
    has the advantage that the minimized view won't overlay anything in the
    current presentation (e.g. your editor...).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    To access the new mode, right-click on the <b>Restore</b> button
    of a minimized stack and select the <b>Show in the Original Location</b> menu item (see image
    below). Note that this change is global, so once it's set, all minimized
    views will use the selected mode.</p>
    <p><img src="images/restore-btn.png" alt=""/></p>

    <p>Here's what the current mode looks like:</p>
    <p><img src="images/use-overlays.png" alt=""/></p>
    <p>Here's what the new mode looks like. Note how the editor
    has been pushed to the right rather than being obscured:</p>
    <p><img src="images/no-overlays.png" alt=""/></p>
    <p>
    We're really interested in your feedback on this! The initial response
    has been positive enough that we're considering making the non-overlay
    mode the default. What do you think? (Post your comments <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=426556" target="_blank">here</a>).

  <tr id="protect-option">
    <td class="title">New protection options for Eclipse</td>
    <td class="content">
     	A new launcher parameter named <b>-protect</b> has been introduced and it accepts the following values:
		<ul>
		<li><b>-protect root</b> can be used to prevent Eclipse from being started as a root user, 
		either directly or via programs that run with administrative privileges like 'sudo'. 
		This option is currently implemented only on Linux/UNIX based platforms.</li>
		<li><b>-protect master</b> can be used to prevent starting of the master instance in a shared install configuration.
		This option can be used on all platforms supported by Eclipse.</li>	
		</ul>
		<p>The above options can either be set in the launcher's <b>.ini</b> file or can be used directly from the command line (e.g eclipse -protect root).</p>

    <td class="title">Signed SDK Executables (for Windows and Mac)</td>
    <td class="content">We now provide signed Windows and Mac executables for the Eclipse SDK.
      This gets rid of those operating system warnings about running untrusted software, and
      saves you from having to disable "Gatekeeper" or other security measures to run Eclipse.

      Based on a community contribution, lots of of the existing GIF icons in the Eclipse platform have been replaced by PNG icons.
      This makes Eclipse icons look better on a dark background, as for example the toolbar on Mac OS X or on a dark theme.

    <td class="content">
      The workbench now supports dynamically changing icons at runtime. This means that workbench themes (such as the dark theme), can
      introduce different icons, and these changes will take effect without requiring a restart.

    <td class="content">
       In cooperation with Canonical, the Eclipse Platform team has been working on improving the presentation of Eclipse menus in Ubuntu, which had

        <li><b>3</b> for GTK+ 3.x </li></ul>
        <p>Note that setting the GTK+ version via this parameter takes precedence over setting the SWT_GTK3 environment variable.
