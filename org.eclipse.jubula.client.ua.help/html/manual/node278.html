    <ul>
      <li>You can either enter a Test Suite to be executed or a Test Job . Only one of these two commands is accepted for the test executor. <li>If you are starting a Test Suite , your AUT will be started from its configuration. You must enter the configuration name using the correct parameter for the testexec. <li>If you are starting a Test Job , you must make sure that the first AUT you require is already started with the <i>autrun</i> command. You must then enter the AUT ID as a parameter for the testexec. Any other AUT&#39;s required during the test must either also be started already, or started as a part of the test itself. When working with Test Jobs , you must use a separately started AUT Agent . You cannot use the embedded AUT Agent with testexec when you are starting a Test Job . </ul>
