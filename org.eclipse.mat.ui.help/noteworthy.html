	<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">Here are descriptions of some of the more interesting or
		significant changes made to the Memory Analyzer for the 1.4 release.
	</p>

		<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Links from Leak Hunter report</h2>
			
			<p class="p">
			The Leak Hunter report now has links to the queries used to create the report.
			Clicking on the link reruns the single query allowing more detailed analysis to be 
			performed manually.
			<br/><div class="imageleft"><img class="image imageleft" src="mimes/leaksuspects1.png" alt="screen shot of leak suspect details showing links"/></div><br/>
			</p>

		</div>

		<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">OQL improvements</h2>
			
			<div class="p">
			OQL now allows range access to arrays and lists using the following syntax:
			<pre class="pre codeblock">SELECT s.value.@valueArray[s.offset:s.offset + s.count - 1] FROM java.lang.String s</pre>

			OQL also allows a greater range of expressions in select items and from items.
			These changes are experimental; feedback is welcome.
			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Improved undo for Notes View and OQL Pane</h2>
			
			<p class="p">
			The OQL pane now has undo/redo with Ctrl-Z/Ctrl-Y. The notes view has an improved undo
			and indicates a dirty pane with an asterisk in the title.
			</p>

		</div>

		<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Queries recognize more JDK class versions</h2>
			
			<ul class="ul">
			<li class="li">Collection class queries
			<p class="p">
			The collection class queries recognize more of the standard JDK Collection classes, across more JDK versions (1.5,1.6,1.7,1.8).
			This includes LinkedList classes from JDK 7 (bug 426369).
			</p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">SaveValueAsQuery
			<p class="p">This now recognizes JDK 7 Strings without offset and count fields.
			</p>

			</li>

			</ul>

		</div>

		<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Huge dumps</h2>
			
			<p class="p">A problem with huge dumps with 2<sup class="ph sup">31</sup> to 2<sup class="ph sup">32</sup> inbound references has been fixed and they can now be parsed and opened.
			Still larger dumps should also be opened. Another problem opening HPROF dumps with very large arrays has been fixed.
			</p>

		</div>

		<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">New and Noteworthy for Memory Analyzer 1.3</h2>
			
			<p class="p">
				The New and Noteworthy document for version 1.3 is available 
				<a class="xref" href="http://www.eclipse.org/mat/1.3.0/noteworthy.html">here</a>.
