    <p> When using code coverage, please bear the following in mind: <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Code Coverage is only possible with AUT&#39;s started via an AUT configuration <a href="node82.html#configuringaut">3.7.1</a> (i.e. not using the <i>autrun</i> command), and which use Java 1.5 or higher. <li>JaCoCo manipulates the byte code of your AUT at runtime to be able to measure code coverage. It is therefore highly sensitive to other byte code manipulations that take place at the same time (e.g. cglib). <li>If you wish to analyze the Code Coverage at the source code level, as well as entering the <i>Source Directory</i> in the AUT configuration, you must also ensure that your class files have been compiled with debug information. <li>Running Code Coverage analyses can become memory-intensive for larger AUT&#39;s . A pattern can be used to reduce the code analyzed. You can also increase the heap space for the ITE to ensure that enough memory is available. We have successfully performed code coverage analysis with JaCoCo on an AUT with 72,000 classes. <li>Users working with the embedded Database may run into memory problems sooner than users working with an Oracle Database . Please remember that we do not recommend working with the embedded Database for productive use. </ul>
    <p><span class="textbf">The AUT does not start when Code Coverage is enabled</span><br /> If the AUT starts normally without Code Coverage but does not when Code Coverage is activated, ensure that you are not using the embedded AUT Agent . <p><span class="textbf">The Test Result Summary View displays the monitoring agent as <i>JaCoCo</i>, but the coverage value is 0</span><br /> If you can open the HTML report for the Code Coverage, but it shows &quot;<i>NaN</i>&quot;, then this could mean that the class files for the analysis were not found. Check the path to the <i>Installation Directory</i> in the AUT configuration. It could also be the case that other byte code manipulations were running at the same time as JaCoCo. <p>
