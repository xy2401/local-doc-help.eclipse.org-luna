They can be used to specify particular behavior in case of an error in one part of the test tree, or they can be placed so as to affect how the test continues. If an Event Handler contains Test Steps /Test Cases , the specified reentry will happen when the Event Handler has been executed. <p> Customized Event Handlers are valid for all Test Cases under the Test Case where the Event Handler is nested, unless one of these child Test Cases has an Event Handler of its own for this error type. <p>
