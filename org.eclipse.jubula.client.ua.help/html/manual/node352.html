This Test Case is then also reused in one place - again alone which is then reused in one place alone in another Test Case and so on. Such hierarchies can often be redundant: the Test Case at the bottom of the hierarchy could just as well have been reused directly in the Test Case at the top of the hierarchy. <p> Such empty chains are collected during the analysis (which may take longer on larger Projects ) and displayed in the Search Result View. They are shown in order of their length, starting with the longest chains. <p>
