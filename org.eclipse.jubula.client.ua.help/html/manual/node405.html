In SWT and RCP there is no method like the Swing <i>setName</i> method to name components in the program code. However, you can improve the testability of your application by using the following method in your SWT or RCP code for the current component class: <i>setData(String key, String ComponentName)</i>. For the key, use <i>TEST_COMP_NAME</i>. <p> Even if you do not name components, you can choose to have unique names generated for your components in the AUT in the AUT dialog <a href="node80.html#Defineaut">3.6</a>. <p>
