    <p> This category has four subcategories. Each subcategory contains a test which reuses a Test Case to execute a calculation in the Simple Adder which will cause an error. After the error, a reset is carried out. <p> An Event Handler has been specified in the <i>bound_modules_samples</i> Project . The Event Handler has been added to the Test Case , and checks that text in the result field is <i>jackpot</i>. <p> The four tests are as follows: <br />
    <p><span class="textbf">Continue</span><br /> The Event Handler in this test has the reentry property <i>continue</i>. When the error occurs, the Event Handler is activated. Once the check has been carried out, the test continues, and the reset is performed. <br /><span class="textbf">Exit</span><br /> The Event Handler in this test has the reentry property <i>exit</i>. When the error occurs, the Event Handler is activated. Once the check has been carried out, the test finishes. The reset is not performed. <br /><span class="textbf">Pause</span><br /> The Event Handler in this test has the reentry property <i>pause</i>. When the error occurs, the Event Handler is activated. Once the check has been carried out, the test pauses. By un-pausing the Test Suite in the client, the test continues. <br /><span class="textbf">Retry</span><br /> The Event Handler in this test is different to the Event Handler in the other tests. It contains the same steps as the test itself, but the parameter references have been switched. This essentially changes the order in which the numbers are entered into the Simple Adder. The Event Handler has the reentry property <i>retry</i>. When the error occurs, the Event Handler is activated. The calculation is redone with the switched values. The failed Test Step (i.e. the original check) is retried, and there is no error. The test is marked as successful. <br />
