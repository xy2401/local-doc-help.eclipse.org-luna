    <p><span class="textbf">Performance in the AUT may be affected</span><ul>
        <li>The recordings that Chronon performs are very memory-intensive. For this reason, you may notice performance differences in your AUT . It may also be necessary to increase the step delay for your tests, and / or add extra synchronization to compensate for the performance differences when Chronon is running. <li>For these reasons, we do not recommend having Chronon configured as a part of your standard AUT configuration. Instead, we suggest running tests with Chronon monitoring when needed. <li>We also strongly suggest ensuring that your AUT and the machine it is running on have sufficient memory to cope with the increased monitoring activity. </ul>
    <p><span class="textbf">Stopping or restarting the AUT will cause the previously recorded information to be lost</span><ul>
        <li>The recording files are written when the AUT is stopped. This means either stopping the AUT by hand, using the &quot;<i>Stop AUT</i>&quot; button in on the toolbar in the ITE or when you use the <i>restart</i> action. <li>Because of this, we recommend executing individual Test Cases (use cases) in Test Suites that you want to analyze with Chronon. You should ensure that any Event Handlers in the Test Suite will not cause the AUT to restart. </ul>
