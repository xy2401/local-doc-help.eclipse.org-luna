    <h3><a name="SECTION00721200000000000000"> <span class="arabic">6</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span> Test execution</a></h3> Tests are generally execute by sending real clicks and key presses, in the same way that a manual tester would. This means that a test will give you the same results as a manual test - if a menu is disabled, an item can&#39;t be selected and so on. <p> Once clicks and key presses have been sent, we wait for confirmation from the AUT that they have arrived (manual testers use their eyes, we use confirmers). <p> If the AUT or the components in it need to be scrolled to access the area being tested, scrolling happens automatically. In the same way, if a tree is collapsed, you do not need to specify an expand action before selecting a node. The expansion is done as part of the selection. <p>
