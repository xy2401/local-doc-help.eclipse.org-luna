<H1>Creating fast views</H1>

<p>Fast views are hidden views that can be quickly opened and closed. They work 
  like other views except they do not take up space in your Workbench window.
</p>

<p>To create a fast view:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click the title bar of the view that you want. Hold the mouse button down.</li>
  <li>Drag the view to the Fast View bar and release the mouse button. By default the shortcut bar is located in the lower left corner of the window.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, you can click on the button located on the left side of the 
  Fast View bar which will present you with a selection of views. Choosing one 
  of these views will add it to the Fast View bar immediately. </p>

<p>The icon for the view that you dragged now appears on the shortcut 
  bar. You can look at the view by clicking its icon on the shortcut bar. As soon 
  as you click somewhere else outside the view, it is hidden again.
</p>

<p>To restore the view to its original location (and remove it from the Fast View bar), toggle 
  the fast view item in the view button's context menu. </p>
<p>You can also create and restore fast views by selecting <b>Fast 
  View</b> from the context menu that opens when you click the 
  icon at the left side of the view's title bar.
