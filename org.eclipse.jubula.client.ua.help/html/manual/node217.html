    <ul>
      <li>While the Object Mapping Mode is active, the AUT cannot be used. <li>To collect a technical name for a component, click the component whose name you want to collect. <li>If the AUT you are mapping has been specified as a multi-window AUT in the AUT configuration <a href="node101.html#AdvancedAUTConfigHTML">3.7.6.2</a>, then you will see an extra button in the Object Mapping Editor . When multiple windows are open, then you can choose between the windows - the window you choose is the window in which the mapping will take place. You should open the new window before starting the Object Mapping Mode . You can switch back and forth between windows by selecting them in the Object Mapping Editor . <li>You will also need to use the HTML actions to switch between windows in your test. </ul>
