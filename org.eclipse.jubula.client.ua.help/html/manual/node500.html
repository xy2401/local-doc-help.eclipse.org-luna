    <p><a name="8514"></a> The AUT Agent is the link between your specified tests and the AUT . Once the AUT Agent has started the AUT , object mapping can take place, and tests can be observed and executed. <p> You can install the AUT Agent on the same machine as the client or on any other machine in the network, as long as the AUT can also run on the machine. The AUT Agent can even run on a different platform than the client. <p> This separation of the client and AUT Agent means that you don&#39;t have to sacrifice control of your machine during test execution. It also means that you can test your AUT on different systems using the same test, and from the same client. <p>
