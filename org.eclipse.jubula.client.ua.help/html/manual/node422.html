    <p> The Windows support is realized using the Microsoft UI Automation Framework. This framework is used to access components and to perform many of the supported actions. The Automation Framework is the recommended approach to controlling .NET AUT&#39;s , and it does not perform clicks or text inputs at the Operating System level; rather it invokes functions on the components. <p> For the majority of the click actions, however, we have implemented real clicks that are performed at the Operating System level in order to allow e.g. opening of context-menus via right click, clicks at specific positions and position-based access (e.g. for context-menus, move actions and check at mouse position). <p>
