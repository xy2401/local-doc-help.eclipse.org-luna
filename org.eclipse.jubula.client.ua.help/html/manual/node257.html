    <p> You can create a new task with pre-filled information directly from an open test result report in the Test Result View . This is useful if a test has failed and you want to create e.g. an issue in your bug-tracking system for the failure. <ol>
        <li>In an open test result report, select the node that best describes the test failure (e.g. a Test Case or Test Step that has failed, or the whole Test Suite , then right-click and select: <br />
          <table border="0" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">
            <tr>
              <td bgcolor="#DDDDDD">Create a Mylyn Task</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br /> from the context-sensitive menu. <li>In the dialog that appears, select a repository in which to create the task. A <i>local</i> repository is available by default, but you can also add connections to Bugzilla and Trac repositories by clicking &quot;<i>Add Task Repository</i>&quot; in the New Task Dialog. Connectors to other repositories can also be added. See the Mylyn documentation for more details on adding repositories. <li>Click &quot;<i>Finish</i>&quot; once you have selected your repository. <li>The editor for a new task will appear. It is pre-filled with information relevant to the node that you selected. Edit the task to make it descriptive enough for a bug report and save the editor. <li>Once you have created a task, you can activate it to start saving your context for this task. See the later section <a href="node256.html#TasksActivateTask">3.22.2.2</a> for details. </ol>
