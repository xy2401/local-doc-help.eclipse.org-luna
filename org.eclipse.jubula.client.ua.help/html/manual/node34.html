    <p> This category and the ones following it contain Test Cases which are used in the executable Test Case <i>2_DVD_TOOL_FULL_TEST</i> and the Test Suite of the same name. <p> The Test Case in this category contains a reused Test Case from the <i>bound_modules_samples</i> Project . It contains Test Cases to add a category to the DVD Tool via the menu. The parameter for the category name has been referenced, as has a variable to read the category name entered for use later in the test. <p> The original Test Case in the <i>bound_modules_samples</i> Project had no data. When it was reused here, three data sets were added. This means that the Test Case is executed three times, each time entering a different category name, and storing the name as a variable. <p>
