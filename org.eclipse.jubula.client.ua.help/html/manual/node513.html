    <p><a name="8624"></a> <a name="testsuite"></a><p> Test Suites are the containers for Test Cases to be executed and can contain as many Test Cases as necessary. Each Test Suite must be bound to one AUT which it will test. An AUT can be bound to more than one Test Suite . <p> An important concept for testing is the ability to test a program modularly. Program parts can be tested as and when they are delivered using the specific Test Suites for each part. Only the chosen Test Suite in a project will be executed, which means that testing can begin whether all program components are available/functional or not. <p>
